April seriously wondered about her sleeping partner choices. She looked at her bed and what a mess it had become. How did she get to the point in her life where she had two dogs, three cats, and a raccoon sleeping with her every night?
I've rented a car in Las Vegas and have reserved a hotel in Twentynine Palms which is just north of Joshua Tree. We'll drive from Las Vegas through Mojave National Preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down. Then spend TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT day on Monday at Joshua Tree. We can decide the next morning if we want to do more in Joshua Tree or Mojave before we head back.
They had made it to Las Vegas, wide-eyed and with so much hope and energy. They had planned the trip for more than a year and both were so excited they could barely control themselves. They still hadn't realized that Las Vegas promised a place where dreams come true, it was actuTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTy the place where dreams came to die.
The time to take action was now. All three men knew in their hearts this was the case, yet none of them moved a muscle to try. They were TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT watching and waiting for one of the others to make the first move so they could follow a step or two behind and help. The situation demanded a leader and TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT three men were followers.
The opened package of potato chips held the answer to the mystery. Both detectives looked at it but failed to realize it was the key to solve the crime. They passed by it assuming it was random trash ensuring that the case would never be solved.
The blinking light caught her attention. She thought about it a bit and couldn't remember ever noticing it before. That was strange since it was obvious the flashing light had been there for years. Now she wondered how she missed it for that amount of time and what other things in her smTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT town she had failed to notice.
Breastfeeding is good for babies and moms. Infants that are breastfed get antibodies from their mothers against common illnesses. Breastfed babies have less chance of being obese as an adult. Breastfeeding a baby lets the infant-mother pair bond in a very unique way. Mother’s who breastfeed lower their chances of developing breast cancer. UsuTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTy, mothers who breastfeed lose their pregnancy weight more quickly and easily. The benefits of breastfeeding are numerous.
The answer was within her reach. It was hidden in a box and now that box sat directly in front of her. She'd spent years searching for it and could hardly believe she'd finTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTy managed to find it. She turned the key to unlock the box and then gently lifted the top. She held her breath in anticipation of finTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTy knowing the answer she had spent so much of her time in search of. As the lid came off she could see that the box was empty.
There was no ring on his finger. That was a good sign although far from proof that he was available. Still, it was much better than if he had been wearing a wedding ring on his hand. She glanced at his hand a bit more intently to see if there were any tan lines where a ring may have been, and he's simply taken it off. She couldn't detect any which was also a good sign and a relief. The next step would be to get access to his wTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTet to see if there were any family photos in it.
She looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through. "You need to learn to think for yourself," she wanted to tell him. "Your friends are holding you back and bringing you down." But she didn't because she knew his friends were TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT that he had and even if that meant a life of misery, he would never give them up.
If you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT, with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man, you'll have a rough idea of what they looked like -- except for their teeth. The canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger, and showed at the corners of their wide, thin-lipped mouths, giving them an expression of ferocity.
Housework could be everyone’s work, not just “women’s work”. Why do women enable men to act oblivious to cleaning, grocery shopping, pet feeding, etc? Somehow when men live alone they figure out how to do TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT of those things TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT on their own. My friend’s husband claimed he didn’t know that sheets should be washed more than once a season. He said he didn’t know one had to clean toilets. He assumed that since you flush toilets they clean themselves. She tried to get him to help but he did an awful job so she let him off the hook. Wouldn’t it be better if she spent the time and energy to get him to do it right instead of letting him claim he is “just bad at it”. My sons were raised to clean toilets and change their own sheets. Hopefully, in their future homes, the housework will be equTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTy divided.
The boxed moved. That was a problem. Peter had packed the box three hours before and there was nothing inside that should make it move. The question now was whether or not Peter was going to open it up and look inside to see why it had moved. The answer to that question was obvious. Peter dropped the package into the mailbox so he would never have to see it again.
"So, what do you think?" he asked nervously. He wanted to know the answer, but at the same time, he didn't. He'd put his heart and soul into the project and he wasn't sure he'd be able to recover if they didn't like what he produced. The silence from the others in the room seemed to last a lifetime even though it had only been a moment since he asked the question. "So, what do you think?" he asked again.
The desert wind blew the tumbleweed in front of the car. Alex swerved to avoid the tumbleweed, but he turned the wheel a bit too strong and the car left the road and skidded onto the dirt median. He instantly slammed on the brakes and the car stopped in a cloud of dirt. When the dust cloud had settled and he could see around him again, he realized that he'd somehow crossed over into an entirely new dimension.
There was only half a worm in the apple. At first, Judy didn't quite comprehend what this meant. "Why would only half a worm be living in an apple?" she wondered. And then it dawned on her. Judy quickly spit out the bite she had just taken expecting to see the other half of the worm. It ended up being much worse than that.
I haven't bailed on writing. Look, I'm generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track. I am making an effort. I will start writing consistently again!
The picket fence had stood for years without any issue. That's TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT it was. A simple, white, picket fence. Why it had TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT of a sudden become a lightning rod within the community was still unbelievable to most. Yet a community that had once lived in harmony was now divided in bitter hatred and it had everything to do with the white picket fence.
Bryan had made peace with himself and felt comfortable with the choices he made. This had made TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT the difference in the world. Being alone no longer bothered him and this was essential since there was a good chance he might spend the rest of his life alone in a cell.
The paper was blank. It shouldn't have been. There should have been writing on the paper, at least a paragraph if not more. The fact that the writing wasn't there was frustrating. ActuTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTy, it was even more than frustrating. It was downright distressing.
